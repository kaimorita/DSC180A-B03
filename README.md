The data needed for our notebooks can be found at: https://zenodo.org/records/7064308. The relevant files are train_val.tar.gz and test.tar.gz. The files must be unzipped and moved to the working directory to run each notebook. The notebooks should be able to be run from top to bottom without errors. The primary notebooks for our results are: gp models.ipynb, linear_model.ipynb, random forest.ipynb.
