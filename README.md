# DSC180A-B03

The data needed for our notebooks can be found at: https://zenodo.org/records/7064308. The relevant files are train_val.tar.gz and test.tar.gz. The files must be unzipped and moved to the working directory to run each notebook. The notebooks should be able to be run from top to bottom without errors. The primary notebooks for our results are: gp models.ipynb, linear_model.ipynb, random forest.ipynb. We chose to use notebook files to convey our code because our code has mutliple different models and thus multiple different outputs and we decided that the best way to demonstrate these outputs in a way that is most understandable is in a notebook format.
